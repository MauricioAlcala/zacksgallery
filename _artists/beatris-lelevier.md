description: >
  Art is a refuge, a haven of peace, colors and passion; I am a soul wondering, learning, enjoying between colors and shades, charcoal and graphite, forms and figures.. <br> Bea Lelevier was born in Ensenada, Baja California, where she lived her early years and youth that now fulfill her of happy and funny memories, close to the sea, feeling the salty smell, the breeze, the water running into her feet, and although she discovered her love to art very young, studies and life took her along other paths, after a while she decided to give a chance to what she really feels in her heart, drawing and painting .. <br> She considers herself a late and mostly autodidact artist, due to she had the opportunity only a few weeks or months to take formal art classes to learn and explore the tools and techniques of artistic expressions; the attraction she has always felt marked her since a little age, drawing constantly; later, then a young adult, she started to paint using different media such as wash painting, acrylic, watercolor, oil and of course drawing.. <br> She has participated in various collective art exhibitions in Tijuana, such as The Treasures of Margarita, the City Gallery, Rosarito ArtWalks ´24 & ´25, Puerto Nuevo Artist Garden, as well as other individual exhibition in art galleries.. <br> She is currently taking formal art classes in oil painting, feeling like a little girl in a playground, or as we say, like ducks in water ..  <br> Beatriz Lelevier  <br> Visual Artist <br> Tijuana, Baja California, México
