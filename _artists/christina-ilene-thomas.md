slogan: My paintings change moods, just as we all do and as nature does.
description: >
 Expansiveness, heart-centered generosity, spirituality, the inexpressible mystery of life, the paradoxical sense of joy and sadness. I hope that my work will elicit a range of emotions in the viewer, to touch or soften peopleâ€™s lives in some way, no matter how small.  My paintings change moods, just as we all do and as nature does. My intuitive, sensitive process takes time to fully express what the painting wishes to be, as I contemplate and listen to each piece. My landscapes are sometimes invitations to stillness and meditation, sometimes expressions of joy, sometimes of drama and mood. I create my titles in hopes that each piece will be further enhanced - the mood, the feeling of it. To me, the titles are just as important as the painting itself. I never paint using a photograph for reference.  All of my paintings are painted by intuition and feeling my way along.
