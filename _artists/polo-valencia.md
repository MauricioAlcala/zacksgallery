 Polo Valencia Garcia is a Mexican painter and gallerist based in Rosarito, Baja California, celebrated for his evocative landscapes of seas, deserts, and the Baja peninsula. Owner of Polo's Fine Art Galleryâ€”a 20+ year-old haven opposite Baja Studios in Popotla- he showcases Baja and international artists while creating his own series, including recent Phoenix desert commissions for Arizona galleries. A vital part of Rosarito's 35-gallery coastal scene, Polo promotes fusion and collaboration, enriching the border region's artistic bridge between Mexico and the U.S. through events like Art Walk Rosarito.
