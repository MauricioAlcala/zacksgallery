  My art is a wild tapestry of the human spirit, stitched together from the fragments
  of imagination and the echoes of unseen worlds. I use bold strokes, jagged lines,
  and a riot of colors—yellow-rimmed eyes gazing through weathered faces, boats
  adrift with stars and flowers, and skeletal figures dancing with plants—I explore the
  tension between order and chaos. Each piece is a collision of abstract forms and
  fleeting narratives, where geometric shards and cryptic symbols like the "X"
  scattered text stories of identity and displacement.
